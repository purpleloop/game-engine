A 2D game engine in Java

# Goals

The goal is to provide a framework for building Java 2D games.

# Description

The engine can be used for two kind of games : 
* 2D action games
* 2D board games


# Disclaimer

The project is in progress since years and still very experimental.
It comes from the merge of several games I have developed during the years.
It is not directly usable for the moment but I'm working on that point ... 

I hope it can be nevertheless useful to anyone.
